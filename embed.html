        <h1>About Beaglier</h1>
        <h3>Image:</h3>
        <img src="dog.jpeg" width="240px">
        <p>The Beaglier is a mixed breed dog — a cross between the <a href="#">Beagle</a> and <a href="#">Cavalier King Charles Spaniel</a> dog breeds. Compact, energetic, and loyal, <br>these pups inherited some of the best qualities from both of their parents.<br>

Beaglier is also spelled Beagalier and Beagelier. Despite their unfortunate status as a designer breed, you may find these pups, in shelters and rescues. <br>So remember to adopt! Don’t shop!</p>
